# Problem to solve:
How could we verify the user interface and make sure the user interface work correctly?

# Importance:
The user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and software occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the software from the human end, at the same time the software simultaneously feeds back information that useful to the users.
The goal user interface is to produce a user interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a software in the way which produces the desired result. This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the software minimizes undesired outputs to the human. As the result, the quality of user interface is an important part to the quality of the entire software. Also, the user interface has the most impact on user.

# Current state:
Engineers tend to focus on backend test. For the front engineers, project manger, when they finish the development of the user interface, they tend to check whether it works by clicking the user interface. The test on user interface is not a easy work. First, it should develop kinds of scenarios and design a sequence of user action to perform the scenarios. Also, at the same, it need a person to supervise the result of test. The test on user interface is performed slightly. 


# Proposed solution:
Design one framework or improve an existing framework as an automatic testing tool for user interface. Give a standard method to test and verify the user interface. An automatic testing tool can be based on scenarios.

# Research question:
What is a good automatic testing framework for user interface?

# Evaluation plan:
1. We will analyze 3 popular framework（Selenium，Katalon Studio，Watir） of user interface tasting and compare them from the perspective of performance, how hard to use, the situations it is suitable.

2.  Perform user interface tests for website, ios and Android apps and desktop application.
